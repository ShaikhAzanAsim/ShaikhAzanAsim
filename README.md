👋 Hi, I’m **@ShaikhAzanAsim**!

I'm a passionate developer with expertise in **C++, JavaScript, Python**, and **PHP**, and I'm currently diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence**, **Cybersecurity**, and **DevOps**. My journey revolves around combining my technical skills with real-world applications, whether it's developing **AI models**, ensuring robust **security solutions**, or streamlining **DevOps** processes to improve collaboration and efficiency in development and operations.

### 👀 **What I'm Interested In**:
- **Cricket**: A sport I enjoy both playing and analyzing. Fun fact: I’m known for my unbeatable **cover drive**, and I play better than Babar Azam on a good day!
- **Artificial Intelligence**: I’m building neural networks and developing models that can analyze data, predict outcomes, and create automated systems.
- **Cybersecurity**: Learning how to protect systems and data from cyber threats, and implementing secure coding practices.
- **DevOps**: My top priority right now! I’m passionate about optimizing development and operations workflows using automation tools and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I’m focused on implementing practices that enhance collaboration, automate deployments, and ensure efficient, scalable systems.

### 🌱 **What I’m Currently Learning**:
- **AI**: Building intelligent systems that can think and reason.
- **Cybersecurity**: Best practices to defend systems from hackers and threats, ethical hacking, and security algorithms.
- **DevOps**: Focusing on tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform to improve the deployment process, automate infrastructure, and integrate CI/CD pipelines.

### 💞️ **What I’m Looking For**:
- **Collaborations** on projects related to **AI**, **security**, **DevOps**, or any tech domain where I can apply my experience in coding, machine learning, security, and streamlining development processes.
- I’m actively looking for **DevOps** roles and opportunities where I can help organizations automate their workflows, build efficient infrastructure, and ensure seamless deployment cycles.

### 📫 **Feel free to reach out**:
- Email: [azanasim1@gmail.com](mailto:azanasim1@gmail.com)
- Looking forward to hearing about exciting projects, DevOps opportunities, and new collaborations!

### ⚡ **Fun Fact**:
- I play a better **cover drive** than Babar Azam (or so I believe)!
